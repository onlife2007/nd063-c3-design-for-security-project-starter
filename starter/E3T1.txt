# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
I had tried to run the brute force attack from the attack instance several times and waited for a day.
Unfortunately, it does not show anything except one thing as in the picture and it does not related to brute force attach

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
GuardDuty may have detected the attack in a number of ways, including:
- CloudTrail logging: by detect anomalous API calls.
- Network traffic analysis: by detect anomalous patterns in networking
- Machine learning: by detect anomalous behavior that may be indicative of an attack.
