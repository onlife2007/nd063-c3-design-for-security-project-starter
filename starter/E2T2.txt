Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
1. Security groups should not allow unrestricted access to ports with high risk
2. Security groups should only allow unrestricted incoming traffic for authorized ports

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
We should remove all the inbound rules that don't need in WebAppSG such as these rules: 
- Allow all traffic from any source
- Allow port 22 from any source
- Because the web service receive request from port 5000, so we also can remove the allor port 80 from any source
- And the security group should only allow traffic from ALB security group to port 5000, not from any source
