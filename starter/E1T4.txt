Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The security group WebAppSG that attach to the Web service instance allow many inbound rules that don't need.
Example: 
    Rule: allow all trafic from the internet

Because the web app is placed behind the load balancer it should only allow traffic from load balancer on specific port
In this case, allow port 5000 from ALB SG

# Poor practice 2
The InstanceProfileRole role assume by Web service instance and Attacker instance is allow all actions in S3 on all resources/buckets.

We should only allow permission that the applicetion need (the least privilege). In this case it could be read only on the Free recipes bucket
